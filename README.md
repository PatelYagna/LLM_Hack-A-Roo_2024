# Emergency AI 911 Dispatcher

## Authors
Daniel Huynh and Yagna Patel

## Problem
Traditional emergency dispatch systems often lack real-time transcription, automated assistance, and visual tracking capabilities. This system addresses these limitations by providing an integrated solution for emergency call handling and dispatch management.

## Statement
This system can be used by emergency dispatch centers to enhance their response capabilities through AI-assisted call handling, automated location detection, and real-time status tracking. The interface helps dispatchers manage emergency calls more efficiently while maintaining accurate records and providing visual feedback.

## Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```python
pip install flask
pip install flask-socketio
pip install sounddevice
pip install openai
pip install numpy
pip install wave
```
1. Insure you have a VALID OPEN API KEY to insert into the code
2. Ensure you have valid OpenAI API credentials configured in the EmergencyDispatcher class.

3. Run the `Gui-1.py` file to start the server.

4. Access the interface through a web browser at `localhost:5000`.

5. The interface provides the following features:
   - Real-time speech recognition and transcription
   - AI-assisted response generation
   - Automatic location detection and mapping
   - Emergency type classification
   - Unit dispatch tracking
   - Call status monitoring

## Additional Details
- The system uses Flask and Socket.IO for real-time web communication
- OpenAI's Whisper model handles speech-to-text conversion
- OpenAI's GPT model provides AI-assisted responses via GPT "Assistants"
- OpenStreetMap integration for location visualization
- Real-time updates for transcript, dispatch status, and emergency summaries

- Key libraries and services used:
   - `Flask: Web framework`
   - `Socket.IO: Real-time communication`
   - `OpenAI API: Speech recognition and AI assistance`
   - `Sounddevice: Audio processing`
   - `Leaflet.js: Map visualization`
   - `OpenStreetMap: Geocoding services`

## Limits
- Requires stable internet connection for API services
- Speech recognition accuracy depends on audio quality
- Location detection relies on address mention in conversation
- Limited to predefined emergency types (Medical, Fire, Police)
- Requires OpenAI API key

## Strengths
- Real-time processing and updates
- Automated speech recognition and transcription
- Intelligent response generation
- Visual mapping and location tracking
- Comprehensive emergency type detection
- Automated unit dispatch suggestions
- Multilingual Dispatcher

## Expansions
- Add support for multiple concurrent calls
- Implement direct emergency service integration
- Add video call capabilities
- Expand emergency type classifications
- Integrate with external dispatch systems
- Add historical call data analysis

## Complexity
**Time Complexity for Key Operations**
- Speech detection: O(n) where n is the audio chunk size
- Address detection: O(n) where n is the transcript length
- Emergency type detection: O(1) using pattern matching
- Location geocoding: O(1) API call
- Real-time updates: O(1) per event

**Space Complexity for Key Components**
- Audio buffer: O(n) where n is the recording duration
- Transcript history: O(n) where n is the conversation length
- Emergency summary: O(1) fixed size structure
- Map data: O(1) single location tracking
- Dispatch status: O(m) where m is the number of dispatched units

## Conclusions 
In conclusion, this program helps with real time analysis and appropriate emergency response classification with multilingual support. It helps reduces fatigue and stress for 911 dispatchers. Additionally, this program helps in understaffed areas with high volume calls and make dispatches efficient and less time consuming. Furthermore, if a human dispatcher is held up on a call then it will take up valuable human resources from other calls however AI can mitigate that.
